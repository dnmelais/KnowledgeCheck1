            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p> Hello future employers! I'm excited about this journey I'm on with all my fellow future UX Designer and Front End Web Dev peers in Code Lou Class of Winter 2023! I'm most excited about learning about user experience design, because it all about making the user experience simple, intuitive and satisfying! I love thinking about everyday products and how they could better serve the user's needs, and would love the opportunity to shape the user's experience from the inside out. I can't wait to work on projects where I get to be involved with solution based research, design, testing and implementation of a product that makes a user's experiences more efficient and enjoyable. I hail from the northernmost Southern city in the United States, Louisville, KY! For the past decade, I have been elevating the interiors of my client's homes and offices as a painting contractor specializing in decorative finishes, color consultations and some light interior design. I am now on the path to pursuing a new career in UX Design and Front End Web Dev, drawing on my passion for sharing the enjoyment that is achievable where good design meets functionality. I'm a dog-lover, nature-lover, avid reader and lifelong learner. I enjoy exploring new cities and taking in new cultures and experiences. Looking forward to landing my first job in UX and web design-- Maybe as a member of your team! Thanks for visiting my website! -Nadia </p>
